                  | All MusicSOL students are enrolled in weekly group music theory classes. Music theory plays a central role in the education of every MusicSOL student. The study of theory includes a wide range of subjects, from hands-on training in musical skills to more advanced research on musical structure and music&rsquo;s composition. The goal of the MusicSOL theory department is not only to provide students with a solid technical foundation, but also to encourage their ongoing intellectual engagement with music as an art form.

                  | Music Theory courses begin every month and are capped at 10 students per class to create the optimal learning environment for students of all ages.

Music unites people, forming bonds that might not exist otherwise. Music can connect different cultures, promote diversity and friendship. Music encourages creative thinking, discipline, leadership, and problem solving. As the great Hans Christian Andersen once said, &ldquo;Where words fail, music speaks.&rdquo;

              | MusicSOL students are provided with a safe space to practice together after class, discuss topics studied, and create a strong friendship bond that will last a lifetime.
